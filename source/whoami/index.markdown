A compulsive existentialist seeker. Always looking for something new to tinker with and botch.

For a day job, I crunch numbers and pose to be a Data Scientist at [Fractal Analytics][1]. Outside of that I am usually found talking to myself, or worse, my laptop.

I live in Bombay and hail from Delhi, India.
