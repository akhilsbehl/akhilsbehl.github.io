[Octopress][octo] is a blogging framework for hackers!

This is yet another post from an Octopress starter in praise of the platform. For me, it is an ode to the *minimalism* and *simplicity* of this tool that I feel compelled to proclaim the happiness I derive from it.[^1]

### Simplicity and Minimalism

This is a 'hello, world!' post and I **really** wanted it to be about Octopress. Why, you ask? Let me give you a few other times when using a technological tool has filled me up with so much love.

* Switching from Internet Explorer to Firefox.
* Switching from Windows to Linux.
* Switching from Ubuntu to ArchLinux.
* Switching from foobar to Vim.
* Switching from foobar to Git.

Each of those transitions, at least for me, were transitions from *complexity* and *opaqueness* into *simplicity* and *minimalism*, and, therefore, the ensuing transparency. Now, I am aware that these moves may seem to be in the absolute opposite direction to may people. To them, I can only say that I am, perhaps, a biased [blub programmer][blub].

### Feels like home!

In the past I've used blogger, a google site, and a weebly site but nothing ever felt like home (perhaps only ASCII feels like home to me!).[^3] It was always the Windows-y (GUI?) feeling where I kept fighting against the tools which kept taking away from the happiness in *doing*.

But, what do I feel right now as I write this? I feel calm like I have found my [zone][joelzone] where I can use a tool-chain (my markup language, my editor, my operating system, ...) each element of which I have curated after trial and experience and which makes me productive. I am writing a *markdown* file in *(G)Vim* and watching this build up in *Chromium*. After I am done, I will push this out using *git* to be published via *github* pages. It is all *pure text* and a *version controlled* copy sits on my *[Archbox][arch]* where I can use my favorite *gnu utilities* to tinker with it. What can I say? It feels like **home**!

### Foolproof and futureproof

I'm a fool and the future is harsh. But what do I care?

Let Octopress and / or [Jekyll][jekyll] disappear tomorrow. Let people make newer, crazier, and fancier tools. I can rest assured that markdown and pure HTML will always be good enough to serve my publishing needs. And I can be sure that someone will keep writing good software on top of these primitives. At least, I can be sure that I can write it for myself if and when the need arises. If github shuts down tomorrow, I will take my pages wherever I can afford to publish them eventually.

{% pullquote %}
I need not worry about Google's sudden evil intentions. I need not lock my data in closed formats. I need not worry about processors not getting faster to serve fattening websites. {" I may be proved wrong by the future -- one often is -- but for now I'm confident and happy. And this is why I wanted to write this post and say 'thank you!' "}
{% endpullquote %}

### How to get one for yourself

There are many good tutorials out there. Therefore, I am not going to do one myself. Primarily, because I am still learning myself. But the following links may help. Godspeed!

**The meta discussion:**

* [Alblue's list of advantages of Octopress][alblue-adv]
* [Alblue's list of disadvantages of Octopress][alblue-dis]
* [Another interesting take on Octopress][rayner]
* [Perhaps eventually we'll all move to Jekyll][octojekyll]

**Tutorials:**

* [The official documentation][offdoc]
* [A full walkthrough from webdesign-tuts+][walkthrough]

<!--Footnotes-->
[^1]: Let's assume we are not all *fanboys* even if only for the sake of discussion.

[^2]: No real solution.

[^3]: Yesterday I was so upset with my failing attempts at adding *code snippets* to my weebly site that I deleted all content I have ever published on the web in frustration because I decided I was giving up on blogging altogether. Like the fool that I am, I did not backup and lost much material.
