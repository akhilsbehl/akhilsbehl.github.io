I used to love stackoverflow when it was a read-only site for me. Since I have
started participating to answer questions I have been having some mixed
feelings about the site. Here are my thoughts in no relevant order.

<!--more-->

* The site reeks too much of *gamification*. Even [Wikipedia][wikip] lists the
  site as an example of the new phenomenon (*fad?*). The site's founder
  [Jeff][jeff] has confessed to it in his [blog][jeffbloggam] and in public
  [fora][jeffvidgam] albeit distancing himself from the terminology.
* The gamification is very efficient. Even while I don't feel great about it,
  it is addictive.
* Is the gamification a better incentive, **in the long run** than organic
  online communities, e.g. R-help, or Archlinux Fora? In the long run are
  **incentives** at all a good idea for fostering *online* & *open*
  communities [given the surprising truth about motivations][trumot]?
* The [talk][jobs] about getting better job offers by the other [founder][joel]
  Joel[^1] are suspect.
* Niche languages like [R][r] and projects provide much lesser opportunity to garner higher
  scores because of fewer users.
* There is some [doubt][slackers] about whether the top users are slackers, really smart
  slackers no doubt, or stars. There is some doubt in my mind whether it will
  make me a slacker.
* Fluff questions or simple questions or hot-off-the-oven questions are the
  only ones that earn majority eyeballs and answers. One of the questions I
  scored highly on myself was one where I had just mentioned to a user to use
  the `names` function in R to get names of a list. Some other answers that I
  personally felt were more challenging were left in the cold.
{% pullquote %}
* {" Personally I am wondering if time I spend on stackoverflow is better spent
  on books and blogs and open courseware that will push me in areas of weakness
  such as test driven development and low-level and systems programming. "}
{% endpullquote %}

This is a nebulous mess of ideas in my head. I have not been able to decide if
I want to keep participating. Time will tell. Meanwhile, I will be more
conscious (and *cautious*) of the perils of being *gamified* and hitting a
*plateau*. There is so much more still to learn on [the long road][longroad].

Must stop talking about it then. But must sleep first.

Adieu.
