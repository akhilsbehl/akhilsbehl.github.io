I stumbled upon two different videos today while surfing the web both of which impressed me deeply. It was only later that I connected the dots between the two. The first is a breathtaking example of what human ingenuity and creativity can achieve with machines; the other a luddite damnation of the same phenomenon. I will put these here and refrain from any comments.

[Digitopoly][digitopoly] provides a counter-arguments to the conclusions of the second video which I, personally, found unconvincing in their depth of analysis.
